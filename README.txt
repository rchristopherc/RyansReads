Ryan's Reads is a program designed to keep track of books I've read, am reading, and plan to read.

The program is run through RyansReads.py in IDLE (the program does not run properly in the python command console).

Upon running and entering a book for the first time, the program will automatically create a .csv file within the program directory for storage. DO NOT create this manually, or the program may not read from the .csv file correctly. Manually editing the .csv file is possible but not recommended. I also recommend that you back up the .csv file if you have a very long list that you'd like to keep -- I'm unlikely to have found every bug that would result in the file being completely cleared. It is safe to replace a backup of the csv file (with the name "Books.csv") if it was originally created by the program. If replacing Books.csv, the replacement should be put in the same directory as RyanReads.py.

The two additional scripts should also be kept in the same directory as RyanReads.py.

Thank you!
